# Ludovision

**Ludovision** is a lightweight, client-side tool that streams and displays real-time images uploaded to the [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) social media platform via its firehose. Designed as a proof of concept, Ludovision highlights the fragility of privacy through obscurity and serves as a reminder of the digital footprints we leave behind online.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Streaming**: Scroll infinitely through every image posted to Bluesky in real-time.
- **Interactive Viewer**: Click on an image to view a larger version and access the uploader's profile.
- **Full Gallery View**: Explore the image owner's entire account gallery. *(Requires a Bluesky auth token; see instructions below.)*
- **No Server Required**: Runs entirely client-side for full transparency‚Äîno data is collected or transmitted.
- **No External Libraries**: No remote code loading. Privacy is respected, even in this experiment.
- **Zero Tracking**: The tool operates without any tracking mechanisms, ensuring user anonymity.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

Ludovision connects directly to the Bluesky firehose API and processes public image data to display it in a simple, scrollable interface. It leverages minimal JavaScript to provide functionality without requiring any external dependencies or backend server.

### Setting Up the Full Gallery View

To enable the full gallery view of an image owner's account:
1. Locate the `token` variable in the source code.
2. Replace null with your Bluesky bearer token.
   ```javascript
   const token = null;
   ```
   > *Note: Your Bluesky bearer token can be found in your account settings or by inspecting API calls made by the platform.*

3. Save the changes and reload the tool in your browser.

### The Name
The project is named **Ludovision** as a nod to *A Clockwork Orange*'s Ludovico Technique‚Äîa scene where the protagonist is subjected to aversion therapy. Similarly, scrolling through this unfiltered firehose of images serves as a vivid reminder of how public and permanent our online actions are.

## üåü Purpose

Ludovision was built to:
- Demonstrate how easy it is to aggregate and parse public data.
- Raise awareness of the digital footprints we leave behind on social platforms.
- Explore the concept of privacy through obscurity and its inherent fragility.

**This project is an experiment and is not intended for production use or deployment in a live environment.**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Privacy Note

Ludovision is a tool for exploring publicly available data and does not:
- Store any data locally or remotely.
- Track user activity in any form.
- Interact with any servers by default other than the Bluesky firehose
- Ludovision will accept an auth token for Gallery view. This will identify your activity with Bluesky servers. Use caution.

To use Ludovision locally, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Prerequisites
- A modern browser (tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari).
- Access to the Bluesky firehose API.
- (Optional) A Bluesky auth token for enabling the full gallery view.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ludovision.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder:
   ```bash

3. Launch the tool by opening `index.html` in your browser:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## üéØ Future Goals

- Enhance the interface for better usability.
- Add filters to categorize or exclude specific content.
- Expand support for additional social media APIs (as appropriate).
- Raise awareness about digital privacy and security through further experiments.
