# Active Context: Ludovision

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on enhancing the gallery functionality with improved navigation, loading, and error handling. Recent work has implemented seamless image navigation that loads additional images when reaching the end of the current set and loops back to the first image when no more images are available.

## Recent Changes
1. **Gallery Navigation Improvements**:
   - Implemented continuous gallery navigation with auto-loading of additional images
   - Added image deduplication to prevent duplicate content in galleries
   - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages and retry options
   - Replaced full-screen dimming with subtle loading indicators
   - Converted image loading to Promise-based for better control flow

2. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created the Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
   - Added task documentation for completed features
   - Updated progress tracking to reflect recent improvements

## Next Steps
1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Consider implementing content filtering options beyond the current blur functionality
   - Explore additional visualization options for the image stream
   - Investigate performance optimizations for handling larger volumes of images

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Further enhance mobile experience with touch-optimized controls
   - Add more customization options in the settings panel
   - Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Optimize performance for very long sessions
   - Improve handling of network interruptions
   - Implement more robust WebSocket reconnection logic

4. **Testing**:
   - Test gallery navigation with various profile sizes
   - Verify error handling under different network conditions
   - Conduct cross-browser compatibility testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Privacy and Ethics
- Continuing to balance the educational purpose of demonstrating public data accessibility with responsible implementation
- Ensuring content warnings remain effective and appropriate
- Maintaining the no-tracking, no-data-collection approach as a core principle

### Technical Considerations
- Evaluating the current WebSocket implementation for stability and reliability
- Considering the impact of Bluesky API changes or rate limiting
- Monitoring performance with large volumes of images in the feed and gallery

### User Experience
- Assessing the effectiveness of the current content warning system
- Evaluating the usability of the enhanced gallery navigation
- Considering additional context or information to display with images

### Future Direction
- Determining if additional social platform APIs should be supported
- Considering if educational materials should accompany the tool
- Evaluating whether additional visualization options would enhance the project's purpose
