# Active Context: Ludovision

## Current Work Focus
Video support has been successfully implemented and is now complete. The platform now fully supports both images and videos from the Bluesky firehose, with comprehensive playback, filtering, and resource management capabilities. Focus is shifting to testing, refinement, and future enhancements.

## Recent Changes
1. **Video Support Implementation** (Completed):
   - Added detection and processing of `app.bsky.embed.video` embeds from Bluesky firehose
   - Implemented video playback in feed grid with SVG play button overlays
   - Added HTML5 video player to feed modal with native controls
   - Integrated video support into gallery view with thumbnail display and play icons
   - Implemented video playback in gallery modal
   - Updated navigation to seamlessly handle mixed image/video content
   - Added settings UI for independent image/video filtering
   - Implemented lazy loading for video elements with `preload="none"`
   - Auto-pause videos when leaving viewport to conserve resources
   - Fixed video detection to handle both `app.bsky.embed.video` and `app.bsky.embed.video#view` types
   - Implemented proper video cleanup (stop and unload) when closing modals or navigating
   - Added user-controllable "mute videos by default" setting
   - Replaced Unicode play button with SVG for cross-browser consistency
   - Optimized play button sizes based on user feedback (reduced to 50% of original)
   - Updated all code to use mixed media selectors (`img, video`) throughout

2. **Gallery Navigation Improvements**:
   - Implemented continuous gallery navigation with auto-loading of additional media
   - Added media deduplication to prevent duplicate content in galleries
   - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages and retry options
   - Replaced full-screen dimming with subtle loading indicators
   - Converted media loading to Promise-based for better control flow

3. **Memory Bank Documentation**:
   - Created the Memory Bank structure with core documentation files
   - Added task documentation for completed features
   - Updated progress tracking to reflect recent improvements

## Next Steps
1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Consider implementing content filtering options beyond the current blur functionality
   - Explore additional visualization options for the image stream
   - Investigate performance optimizations for handling larger volumes of images

2. **User Experience Improvements**:
   - Further enhance mobile experience with touch-optimized controls
   - Add more customization options in the settings panel
   - Improve accessibility for screen readers and keyboard navigation

3. **Technical Improvements**:
   - Optimize performance for very long sessions
   - Improve handling of network interruptions
   - Implement more robust WebSocket reconnection logic

4. **Testing**:
   - Test gallery navigation with various profile sizes
   - Verify error handling under different network conditions
   - Conduct cross-browser compatibility testing

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Privacy and Ethics
- Continuing to balance the educational purpose of demonstrating public data accessibility with responsible implementation
- Ensuring content warnings remain effective and appropriate
- Maintaining the no-tracking, no-data-collection approach as a core principle

### Technical Considerations
- Evaluating the current WebSocket implementation for stability and reliability
- Considering the impact of Bluesky API changes or rate limiting
- Monitoring performance with large volumes of images in the feed and gallery

### User Experience
- Assessing the effectiveness of the current content warning system
- Evaluating the usability of the enhanced gallery navigation
- Considering additional context or information to display with images

### Future Direction
- Determining if additional social platform APIs should be supported
- Considering if educational materials should accompany the tool
- Evaluating whether additional visualization options would enhance the project's purpose
