# Product Context: Ludovision

## Why This Project Exists
Ludovision was created to serve as a tangible demonstration of how public data on social media platforms is more accessible and aggregatable than many users realize. Named after the Ludovico Technique from "A Clockwork Orange," the project provides a vivid, sometimes uncomfortable reminder of the permanence and visibility of our digital actions. It challenges the common misconception that content posted online remains obscure simply because it's mixed among millions of other posts.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Awareness Gap**: Many social media users don't fully comprehend how public their "public" posts really are. Ludovision bridges this awareness gap by showing the real-time stream of public images.

2. **Privacy Misconceptions**: There's a widespread belief in "privacy through obscurity" - the idea that content is effectively private if it's difficult to find. Ludovision demonstrates the fragility of this concept.

3. **Educational Challenges**: It's difficult to effectively communicate abstract privacy concepts. This tool provides a concrete, visual demonstration that makes these concepts tangible.

4. **Technical Transparency**: The project shows how social platforms' APIs work in practice, making technical concepts accessible to non-technical users.

## How It Should Work
Ludovision should function as a simple, intuitive window into the Bluesky image firehose:

1. **Immediate Access**: Users should be able to open the HTML file and immediately see the stream of images after acknowledging a content warning.

2. **Continuous Stream**: Images should load automatically in real-time as they're posted to Bluesky.

3. **Minimal Interaction**: The core experience should require minimal user interaction - just scrolling to see more images.

4. **Optional Depth**: Users who want more information should be able to click on images to see larger versions and access profile information.

5. **Gallery Exploration**: With authentication, users should be able to explore an entire account's gallery of images.

6. **Transparent Operation**: The application should make it clear that it's not storing, tracking, or transmitting any user data beyond what's needed to access the Bluesky API.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Immediacy**: Create an immediate impact by showing the volume and variety of public images being shared in real-time.

2. **Simplicity**: Maintain a clean, minimal interface that puts focus on the content stream rather than UI elements.

3. **Thoughtfulness**: Encourage reflection about digital privacy through the experience of viewing the unfiltered stream.

4. **Respect**: Despite its provocative nature, the tool should respect users by implementing content warnings and avoiding tracking.

5. **Education**: The experience should naturally lead users to consider questions about their own digital footprint.

6. **Accessibility**: The tool should work across devices and browsers without requiring special software or technical knowledge.

7. **Transparency**: All functionality should be transparent to users, with no hidden features or data collection.
