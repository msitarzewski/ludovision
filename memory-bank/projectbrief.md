# Project Brief: Ludovision

## Project Overview
Ludovision is a lightweight, client-side tool that streams and displays real-time images uploaded to the Bluesky social media platform via its firehose. It functions as a proof of concept that highlights the fragility of privacy through obscurity and serves as a reminder of the digital footprints we leave behind online.

## Core Requirements
1. Stream real-time images from Bluesky's firehose API
2. Display images in an infinite scroll interface
3. Allow users to view larger versions of images and access uploader profiles
4. Provide gallery view of an image owner's entire account (with authentication)
5. Run entirely client-side without a server
6. Use no external libraries to ensure transparency
7. Implement zero tracking mechanisms

## Project Goals
- Demonstrate how easily public data can be aggregated and parsed
- Raise awareness about digital footprints on social platforms
- Explore the concept of privacy through obscurity and its inherent fragility
- Create an educational tool that respects user privacy

## Technical Constraints
- Must run entirely in the browser (client-side only)
- No server-side components
- No external dependencies or libraries
- Must connect directly to Bluesky's firehose API
- Must support authentication for gallery view functionality

## Target Audience
- Privacy researchers and educators
- Digital security enthusiasts
- Social media users interested in understanding public data exposure
- Developers exploring API capabilities and client-side applications

## Success Criteria
- Successfully streams and displays real-time images from Bluesky
- Provides interactive features (image viewing, profile access, gallery view)
- Maintains zero tracking and complete client-side operation
- Effectively communicates the project's educational purpose
- Functions reliably across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

## Project Scope
This is an experimental project not intended for production use or deployment in a live environment. It serves primarily as an educational tool and proof of concept.
