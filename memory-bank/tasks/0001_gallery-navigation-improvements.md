# Task: Gallery Navigation Improvements

## Task Description
Enhance the gallery functionality with improved navigation, loading, and error handling. Implement continuous navigation that loads additional images when reaching the end of the current set, loops back to the first image if no more are available, and provides robust error handling and user feedback.

## Objective
Enhance the navigation, loading, and error handling for the gallery modal.

## Tasks
- [x] Pin gallery controls to the bottom of the modal, always visible in gallery mode only
- [x] Fix slider/modal interaction bugs (no more accidental closes)
- [x] Ensure grid margin-bottom to prevent controls overlap and improve centering
- [x] Use robust JS/CSS toggling for controls visibility
- [x] Ensure images remain square and responsive
- [x] Thoroughly test and polish gallery UX

## Progress
- Controls are now pinned and only visible in gallery view
- Margin-bottom for grid ensures proper spacing
- All slider/modal close bugs fixed
- Gallery modal and controls are robust against race conditions and browser quirks
- Images remain square and responsive at all sizes
- User experience is smooth and reliable

## Acceptance Criteria
- Seamless navigation through gallery images
- Auto-load additional images when reaching the end
- Loop back to the first image if at the end of the gallery
- Deduplicate images in the gallery view
- User-friendly error messages and retry options
- Subtle loading indicators instead of full-screen dimming
- Promise-based image loading for better control flow
