# Task 0002: Settings Modal Bugfix

**Status:** âœ… Completed
**Created:** 2025-04-27
**Completed:** 2025-04-27

## Objective
Fix the bug preventing the settings modal from opening and functioning in Ludovision. Ensure all modal controls are correctly initialized and accessible throughout the script.

## Context
- The settings modal was not opening due to missing or incorrectly scoped variable declarations for its controls (`sortToggle`, `blurToggle`, `speedSlider`, `speedValue`).
- Previous attempts at lint fixes left placeholder comments but did not restore the actual variable declarations.
- The modal is essential for user customization and control of the Ludovision app.

## Solution
- Properly declared all settings modal control variables at the top of the DOM element section in `script.js`:
  ```js
  const sortToggle = document.getElementById('sort-toggle');
  const blurToggle = document.getElementById('blur-toggle');
  const speedSlider = document.getElementById('speed-slider');
  const speedValue = document.getElementById('speed-value');
  ```
- Removed duplicate/placeholder lines and ensured all references use these single declarations.
- Confirmed modal now opens and all settings controls work as expected.

## Files Modified
- `script.js`

## Verification
- Settings modal opens on hamburger menu click.
- All controls are populated and function as intended.
- No variable or reference errors in the console.

## Next Steps
- Monitor for any further modal or UI bugs.
- Continue with other UI/UX improvements as outlined in the active context.
