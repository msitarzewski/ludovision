# Task: Video Support Implementation

## Task Description
Add comprehensive video support to Ludovision, enabling users to view videos from the Bluesky firehose alongside images. Implement video playback in both feed and gallery views with HTML5 native controls, proper resource management, and user-controllable settings.

## Objective
Extend the platform to support video content from `app.bsky.embed.video` embeds with seamless integration into existing feed and gallery systems.

## Tasks
- [x] Research AT Protocol video support (confirmed: videos supported, audio not natively supported)
- [x] Add video detection in WebSocket firehose handler
- [x] Implement video rendering in feed with play button overlays
- [x] Create video modal with HTML5 controls in feed view
- [x] Add video support to gallery grid view
- [x] Implement video playback in gallery modal
- [x] Add media type filtering settings (Images/Videos checkboxes)
- [x] Implement lazy loading for videos with `preload="none"`
- [x] Add auto-pause for videos leaving viewport
- [x] Update navigation to handle mixed media (images + videos)
- [x] Fix video detection for API responses (handle both record and view types)
- [x] Implement proper video cleanup on modal close/navigation
- [x] Add user-controllable mute videos by default setting
- [x] Create SVG play button overlays (replace Unicode characters)
- [x] Optimize play button sizes (reduced to 50% of original)
- [x] Update all selectors to support mixed media queries

## Progress
- Phase 1: Feed and modal video support implemented
- Phase 2: Gallery video support completed
- Fixed duplicate variable declaration bug
- Replaced Unicode play button with SVG for consistency
- Reduced play button size based on user feedback
- Fixed gallery video detection (handle `app.bsky.embed.video#view` type)
- Implemented comprehensive video cleanup on modal close/navigation
- Added user-controllable mute by default setting with UI

## Implementation Details

### Video URL Construction
```javascript
const videoUrl = `https://video.bsky.app/watch/${profileDid}/${link}/playlist.m3u8`;
const thumbnailUrl = `https://video.bsky.app/watch/${profileDid}/${link}/thumbnail.jpg`;
```

### Video Detection
- Firehose (record type): `app.bsky.embed.video`
- API responses (view type): `app.bsky.embed.video#view`
- Both types now properly handled

### Resource Management
- Videos start muted by default (user-controllable via settings)
- Videos auto-play when modals open
- Videos stop and unload (`src = ''`) when:
  - Modals are closed (ESC, click outside)
  - Navigating from video to image
  - Closing gallery image modal
  - ModalManager.closeAll() is called
  - "View Gallery" button is clicked

### Performance Optimizations
- `preload="none"` for bandwidth conservation
- Auto-pause videos when leaving viewport
- Lazy loading with IntersectionObserver
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

### User Settings
- Show/hide images independently
- Show/hide videos independently
- Mute videos by default (customizable)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Videos display in feed with play button overlays
- [x] Videos open in modal with HTML5 controls
- [x] Videos appear in gallery grid with play icons
- [x] Videos play in gallery modal
- [x] Mixed media navigation works seamlessly
- [x] Settings allow filtering by media type
- [x] Videos cleanup properly when navigating away
- [x] Performance remains optimal with video support
- [x] Play button icons render consistently across browsers
- [x] User can control mute by default behavior

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Added video elements to modals, settings checkboxes
- `script.js` - Video detection, rendering, gallery support, cleanup (~500+ lines)
- `settings-dist.js` - showImages, showVideos, muteVideosByDefault settings
- `styles.css` - Video container, play overlay styles (SVG-based)
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Updated context
- `memory-bank/progress.md` - Updated milestones

## Status
âœ… Completed

## Priority
High

## Notes
- Audio support is NOT available in AT Protocol (no `app.bsky.embed.audio` type)
- Video implementation maintains backwards compatibility with image-only code
- HLS video streaming (.m3u8) used by Bluesky CDN
- All video features tested and working across feed and gallery views
- User feedback incorporated: SVG icons, size adjustments, cleanup behavior, mute control
