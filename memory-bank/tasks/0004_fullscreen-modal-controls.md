# Task: Full-Screen Modal with Auto-Hide Controls

## Task Description
Enhance the image/video modal views (both feed and gallery) with maximized full-screen display and auto-hiding overlay controls for an immersive viewing experience on mobile and desktop.

## Objective
Transform modals from 90% viewport sizing to maximized full-screen display with intelligent auto-hiding controls that provide a clean viewing experience while keeping navigation accessible.

## Requirements
1. **Maximized Display**: Images and videos should use full viewport (max 100vw × 100vh) while maintaining aspect ratio
2. **Close Button**: Traditional X button in upper-right corner for intuitive closing
3. **Auto-Hide Controls**: Controls fade out after inactivity, reappear on interaction
4. **Mobile-Optimized**: Single-tap responsiveness, proper touch handling, adequate tap targets

## Tasks
- [x] Add close button to gallery image modal
- [x] Maximize gallery modal media sizing (100vw × 100vh)
- [x] Create bottom controls overlay with transparent black background
- [x] Implement auto-hide functionality (5 second timer)
- [x] Add close button to feed modal
- [x] Maximize feed modal media sizing
- [x] Move feed modal buttons into overlay
- [x] Fix touch event handling for scrolling compatibility
- [x] Increase auto-hide timer for mobile usability (3s → 5s)
- [x] Prevent hiding when hovering/touching controls
- [x] Use touchend event for reliable mobile tap response
- [x] Remove pointer-events:none to allow single-tap interaction

## Implementation Details

### HTML Changes
**Feed Modal** (`#image-modal`):
```html
<button id="feed-modal-close-button" class="modal-close-button">
  <!-- SVG X icon -->
</button>
<img id="modal-image"> <!-- Removed inline max-width/height -->
<video id="modal-video"> <!-- Removed inline max-width/height -->
<div id="feed-modal-controls" class="modal-controls-overlay">
  <!-- Profile and Gallery buttons -->
</div>
```

**Gallery Image Modal** (`#gallery-image-modal`):
```html
<button id="gallery-modal-close-button" class="modal-close-button">
  <!-- SVG X icon -->
</button>
<img id="gallery-modal-image"> <!-- Removed inline styles -->
<video id="gallery-modal-video"> <!-- Removed inline styles -->
<div id="gallery-modal-controls" class="modal-controls-overlay">
  <!-- View Full Size button dynamically added -->
</div>
```

### CSS Additions
```css
/* Maximized sizing */
#modal-image, #gallery-modal-image {
  max-width: 100vw;
  max-height: 100vh;
  object-fit: contain;
}

/* Close button - upper right */
.modal-close-button {
  position: fixed;
  top: 20px;
  right: 20px;
  width: 44px;
  height: 44px;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  z-index: 130;
}

/* Bottom controls overlay */
.modal-controls-overlay {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  z-index: 125;
}

/* Hidden state - remains clickable */
.modal-close-button.hidden,
.modal-controls-overlay.hidden {
  opacity: 0;
  /* NO pointer-events: none - keeps buttons clickable when faded */
}
```

### JavaScript Implementation
**Auto-Hide Logic**:
- Timer set to 5 seconds (longer for mobile usability)
- Timer pauses when hovering/touching controls
- Timer resets on mouse move, touch, or keyboard interaction

**Mobile Touch Handling**:
- Use `touchend` instead of `click` for immediate response
- Use `{ passive: true }` for smooth scrolling
- Prevent default on button taps to avoid ghost clicks
- Remove `pointer-events: none` so buttons work when faded

**Event Listeners**:
```javascript
// Show controls on interaction
modal.addEventListener('mousemove', showFeedModalControls);
modal.addEventListener('touchend', showFeedModalControls);

// Pause timer when over controls
feedModalCloseButton.addEventListener('mouseenter', () => clearTimeout(timer));

// Close on touchend for reliable mobile response
feedModalCloseButton.addEventListener('touchend', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  closeModal();
}, { passive: false });
```

## Mobile Tap Responsiveness Challenges

### Problem 1: Multiple Taps Required
**Issue**: When controls had `pointer-events: none` while hidden, the first tap would only reveal them, requiring a second tap to actually click.

**Solution**: Removed `pointer-events: none` from `.hidden` classes. Buttons remain clickable even when visually faded (opacity: 0), enabling single-tap close from any state.

**Trade-off**: Users can tap invisible buttons, but this is much better UX than requiring 2-3 taps. Buttons are in predictable locations (top-right, bottom-center).

### Problem 2: Click Events Not Firing
**Issue**: Standard `click` events were unreliable on mobile when button state was transitioning from hidden to visible.

**Solution**: Changed to `touchend` event which fires immediately on tap release, with `preventDefault()` to avoid ghost clicks. Desktop still uses `click` event (filtered by `e.detail !== 0`).

### Problem 3: Timer Too Short
**Issue**: 3-second auto-hide timer didn't give users enough time to tap buttons before they disappeared.

**Solution**: Increased to 5 seconds and added hover/touch pause functionality so timer stops while user is actively over the controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Both feed and gallery modals display media at maximum viewport size
- [x] Close button (X) visible in upper-right corner on modal open
- [x] Controls auto-hide after 5 seconds of inactivity
- [x] Controls reappear on mouse movement, touch, or keyboard interaction
- [x] Close button responds to single tap on mobile
- [x] Touch scrolling works normally (no interference)
- [x] Bottom overlay buttons remain accessible
- [x] Desktop mouse interactions work normally
- [x] Auto-hide pauses when hovering/touching controls

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Added close buttons and controls overlays to both modals
- `styles.css` - Maximized media sizing, close button styles, overlay styles
- `script.js` - Auto-hide logic, mobile touch handlers, event listeners (~150 lines)

## Commits
- `762d4d5` - Add maximized full-screen gallery modal with auto-hide controls
- `3f07c62` - Remove inline styles from gallery modal media elements
- `1e1c110` - Add maximized full-screen display to feed modal
- `53f6aa1` - Improve auto-hide controls for easier mobile interaction
- `52becb8` - Fix close button requiring multiple taps on mobile
- `3e9ff80` - Remove pointer-events:none from hidden controls for single-tap close

## Status
✅ Completed

## Priority
High

## Notes
- This task discovered and fixed both feed modal and gallery modal (initially only planned for gallery)
- Mobile tap responsiveness required three iterations to get right
- Key insight: `pointer-events: none` breaks mobile tap interactions when elements are transitioning between states
- Auto-hide controls provide clean viewing experience while remaining accessible
- 5-second timer with pause-on-hover provides good balance between immersion and usability
