# Gallery Navigation Improvements

## Task Description
Enhance the gallery functionality by implementing a seamless image navigation experience that loads additional images when reaching the end of the current set and allows looping back to the first image when no more images are available.

## Implementation Details

### Completed Features
1. **Continuous Gallery Navigation**
   - Added functionality to load more images when navigating with arrow keys
   - Implemented automatic loading of the next page when reaching the end of current images
   - Added looping back to the first image when no more images are available

2. **Promise-based Image Loading**
   - Converted `fetchGalleryImages` to return a Promise for proper chaining
   - Implemented proper Promise resolution/rejection for all success and error cases
   - Added proper cleanup of resources when gallery is closed

3. **Loading Experience Improvements**
   - Replaced full-screen dimming with a subtle floating loading indicator
   - Added visual feedback during image loading operations
   - Ensured lazy-loaded images are properly loaded when navigated to

4. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Improved error handling for image loading failures
   - Added user-friendly error messages with retry options
   - Implemented proper handling of network interruptions

5. **Image Deduplication**
   - Added logic to prevent duplicate images from appearing in the gallery
   - Implemented efficient tracking of existing image URLs using a Set
   - Added proper checks before adding new images to the gallery

## Technical Implementation
- Used `IntersectionObserver` for efficient lazy loading of images
- Implemented Promise-based asynchronous loading for better control flow
- Added proper state management for gallery navigation
- Ensured proper cleanup of resources to prevent memory leaks

## Code Changes
- Updated `fetchGalleryImages` to return a Promise
- Enhanced navigation logic in gallery modal
- Added deduplication logic for gallery images
- Improved error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Added loading state management for better user experience

## User Experience Benefits
- Seamless browsing through an entire profile's images with just arrow keys
- No need to manually load more images when reaching the end
- Reduced visual interruptions during loading operations
- Better feedback during error conditions
- Smoother overall gallery experience

## Future Considerations
- Potential for further optimization of image loading performance
- Possibility of adding preloading for anticipated navigation
- Consider adding more advanced filtering options for gallery content
